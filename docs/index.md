# Welcome to STAT-462! {#Home .unnumbered}

<br>

Dr Greatrex has written this lab book to provide all the code and instructions you need for regression analysis.  The labs have three main learning objectives.

-   To allow you to practice the statistical concepts from the course

-   To use real-world data-sets.

-   To be comfortable conducting analysis in R and writing up your reports professionally.

You will be conducting analysis using R and writing up your reports using R-Markdown. [Unless I tell you otherwise, you can find all the code you need in this lab book]{.underline}

Don't panic if you are new to this! We will start from scratch and you are expected to have zero programming experience.
