<br>

YOU DO NOT NEED YOUR OWN COMPUTER TO BECOME AN EXPERT R-PROGRAMMER!

There are many options to where you can access R and R-Studio online. The only downside to these is that they can be a little slower and often they cope less well with large datasets.

You can also try to use the lab computers but they are often out of date and will have weird errors.

## Doing your labs online - Posit/R-Studio Cloud Website {#PositCloud .unnumbered}

This is an website based version of R-Studio that is owned by the same team that created it. <br><br>

#### [EVERYONE]{.underline} SHOULD SIGN UP FOR AN ACCOUNT HERE: <https://posit.cloud/>

I believe it's free for the first 25hrs each month. Sadly there is no student pricing right now.

-   Advantages:
    -   It's always up to date
    -   You can do your labs anywhere you have access to a webpage <br>
-   Disadvantages:
    -   You will need to install packages every lab
    -   It's not as powerful, you won't be able to play will millions of data points
    -   You have to be online; bad internet connections make it harder
    -   It's weirdly 'buggy'.

### What if I run out of free time?

There are a few options:

1.  It's easy to transfer your labs, so the easiest solution is to make a second account with another email.

2.  You pay for a single month to get through (about \$5). If you are really short on cash, I will pay for it for you ON THE CONDITION that you click this link and sign up.
